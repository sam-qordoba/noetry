# noetry

A docker image based heavily on [no-pypoetry](https://github.com/Docker-s-IMAGES/no-pypoetry), but with a newer version of Poetry (there was a breaking change in the poetry.lock format) which I install based on [python-poetry-alpine](https://github.com/FrederikP/python-poetry-alpine/blob/master/Dockerfile).
